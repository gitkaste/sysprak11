Hello Fpriend, 

This is an working, albeit not Bug-free implementation of a somewhat braindead
filesharing protocol. It's client-server based, uses a somewhat nifty parser
(probably the most useful component) and is able to transfer files. I haven't
touched this for some time, but this should compile on any run of the mill
unix with a somewhat recent gcc and gnu make, I believe.

I did this for fun; my girlfriend took a course where this was a required group
project, supposed to be done by four people.  Intrigued by the idea of writing
a client-server app, I challenged them to a coding race and this is the result.
The design was given (documented in the sheets saved alongside [in German]) and
I would do it very differently in many ways, but it's implemented somewhat
faithfully.

My C and make skills have improved a great bit since then, so a rewrite would
be in order, especially for the make system. Have a look at
github.com/Skruppellos/sysprak for the project, that I handed in, when I took
the class myself the next year. I believe that's a lot more advanced and you
can see I had a very busy helper and a lot more freedom in the design this time
(HINT: the syslog replacement and the botnet in there weren't in the spec).
